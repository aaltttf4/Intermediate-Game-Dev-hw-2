The theme i chose to go with in my pinball game is sealife. Besides having fish themed sprites, I also wanted the physics to reflect everything being underwater. To achieve this I made the ball fall a bit slower to make it feel a bit mroe floaty. I realized later that this can feel kind of annoying when playing though. I learned a lot about particle effects when I was making this game. I chose to use it for the puffer fish's effect when the ball hits it and the bubbles that float up from the bottom of the screen. I wish I added more obstacles, though. The current ones that I have are quite boring and aren't that difficult to maneuver. The hook also gets kind of weird when it is being reeled up after the ball touches it, which I wasn't sure how to fix. I think I did quite well in following the theme, but some mechanics could be tweaked for better gameplay.
